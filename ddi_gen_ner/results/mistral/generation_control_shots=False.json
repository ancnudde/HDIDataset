Common diuretics include furosemide (Lasix), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and spironolactone (Aldactone).\n\n2. Antacids: Some antacids, such as aluminum hydroxide and magnesium trisilicate, contain high amounts of magnesium and can lead to magnesium overload if taken in excessive amounts.\n\n3.

The diagnostic process involves a comprehensive assessment of the individual's history, physical examination, and various diagnostic tests. Urine drug screens are essential in identifying cocaine use, and other tests like the toxicology screen, HIV test, and hepatitis panel may also be necessary.\n\nTreatment approaches for cocaine abuse include both pharmacological and behavioral interventions. Pharmacological treatments include the use of disulfiram, which produces an aversive reaction when combined with alcohol, and methadone or buprenorphine for opioid dependence that often co-occurs with cocaine abuse. Additionally, there are several FDA-approved medications for nicotine dependence, which can be beneficial for individuals who smoke cocaine.\n\nBehavioral interventions include various forms of psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), contingency management, and motivational interviewing. CBT helps individuals identify and modify the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to their drug use. Contingency management provides incentives for abstinence, while motivational interviewing helps individuals explore and resolve ambivalence about changing their behavior.\n\nAftercare approaches are essential for maintaining long-term sobriety. These include participation in self-help groups like Narcotics Anonymous, regular follow-up appointments with healthcare providers, and ongoing therapy. Additionally, medications like naltrexone can help prevent relapse by reducing cravings and blocking the euphoric effects of cocaine.\n\nCited drugs:\n- Cocaine\n- Alcohol\n- Opioids\n- Nicotine\n\nNote: The text does not explicitly mention any specific brand names of drugs or medications.", {"entities": [[50, 56, "Drug"]]}]], [201, "The general public feels that cocaine is not particularly dangerous because it does not produce a well defined physical dependency and abstinence syndrome.

Corticosteroids: Examples include Prednisone, Dexamethasone, and Methylprednisolone. These drugs work by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune response.\n\n2. Calcineurin Inhibitors: Examples include Tacrolimus and Cyclosporine. These drugs inhibit the activity of T-cells, which are key players in the immune response.\n\n3. mTOR Inhibitors: Examples include Sirolimus and Everolimus. These drugs inhibit the activity of the mTOR complex, which is involved in cell growth and proliferation.\n\n4. Monoclonal Antibodies: Examples include Basiliximab, Muromonab-CD3, and Daclizumab. These drugs work by targeting specific proteins on the surface of immune cells, preventing them from activating the immune response.\n\n5. Belatacept: This is a fusion protein that blocks the CD28 co-stimulatory signal, preventing T-cells from becoming fully activated.\n\nWhile these drugs are effective in suppressing the immune response, they also come with a number of complications. Some of the most common complications include:\n\n1. Infections: Immunosuppressive drugs can increase the risk of infections, as they weaken the body's ability to fight off bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens.\n\n2.

These medications work by blocking the influx of calcium ions into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. However, their effects on platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism have been a subject of interest in recent research.\n\nArachidonic acid is a fatty acid that plays a crucial role in platelet activation and aggregation. CCBs have been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation, which is a key step in the formation of blood clots. This inhibitory effect is thought to be due in part to the modulation of arachidonic acid metabolism by CCBs.\n\nSpecifically, CCBs have been found to increase the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets. cAMP is a signaling molecule that inhibits platelet activation and aggregation. Additionally, CCBs have been shown to decrease the production of thromboxane A2, a pro-aggregatory eicosanoid derived from arachidonic acid.\n\nTwo commonly used CCBs, nifedipine and verapamil, have been studied extensively in this regard.

They are typically used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs).\n\nSome of the first-generation NNRTIs include Nevirapine (Viramune) and Efavirenz (Sustiva). These drugs were initially used as part of three-drug combination therapies, which significantly improved the outcomes for people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nHowever, the emergence of drug resistance has led to the development of new NNRTIs with improved resistance profiles.

The development of fluvastatin began in the late 1980s, with the first human trials taking place in the early 1990s.\n\nFluvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in the production of cholesterol in the liver. This leads to a decrease in the production of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or \"bad cholesterol,\" and an increase in the production of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or \"good cholesterol.\"\n\nFluvastatin has several pharmacological properties that distinguish it from other statins. It is highly selective for HMG-CoA reductase, with little effect on other cellular processes. It also has a unique metabolic profile, with a long half-life and a high degree of protein binding. This allows for once-daily dosing and consistent blood levels of the drug.\n\nFluvastatin is available in several formulations, including tablets and capsules, and is marketed under the brand name Lescol. It is also available in a combination product with the diuretic benazepril, marketed as Vascor. Other statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), simvastatin (Zocor), and rosuvastatin (Crestor).\n\nClinical trials have shown that fluvastatin is effective in reducing LDL cholesterol levels and improving cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypercholesterolemia. It is generally well-tolerated, with the most common side effects being gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Rare but serious side effects include muscle damage (myopathy) and kidney damage (nephrotoxicity).\n\nIn conclusion, fluvastatin is a statin drug developed by AstraZeneca for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.
