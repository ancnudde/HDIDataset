{"id":2798,"text":"St John's Wort (SJW) is widely used in the treatment of depression but concerns have been raised about its potential to interact with other drugs.\nCo-administration with SJW has resulted in significant reductions in trough plasma concentrations of indinavir and cyclosporin [1, 2].\nInduction of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) has been implicated as the most likely interaction mechanism.\nHowever, the magnitude of the interaction seen in clinical practice is greater than that predicted by in vitro studies suggesting additional interaction mechanisms may exist.\nAs indinavir and cyclosporin are substrates for both CYP3A4 and the multi drug transporter P-glycoprotein we hypothesized that modulation of P-glycoprotein expression and function by SJW may contribute to the development of potentially harmful drug–drug interactions.\nHealthy volunteers were randomized to either SJW (0.15%) 600 mg three times daily for 16 days (n = 15) or placebo (n = 7).\nBlood samples were obtained for P-glycoprotein expression and function at baseline, 16 and 32 days post treatment.\nPeripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation, fixed and permeabilized.\nCells were stained with a P-glycoprotein specific antibody, quantified by flow cytometry and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values obtained.\nVimentin and IE (nonsense antibody) were used as controls.\nThe presence of the MDR 1 gene product was confirmed by RT-PCR.\nP-glycoprotein mediated drug efflux was determined as a function of rhodamine efflux in the absence and presence of ritonavir.\nData are expressed as mean±s.d.\nand were subjected to nonparametric analysis.\nP-glycoprotein expression increased 4.2 fold from baseline in subjects treated with SJW (7.0 ± 1.9 vs 29.5 ± 14.3 (MFI); P < 0.05).\nThere was no effect with placebo (5.1 ± 1.3 vs 6.0 ± 1.9 MFI).\nSJW increased P-glycoprotein mediated rhodamine efflux (reduced ratio) compared with baseline (0.12 ± 0.04 vs 0.24 ± 0.18 P < 0.05).\nThere was no change with placebo.\nRitonavir (5 µ SJW increased expression and enhanced the drug efflux function of the multi drug transporter P-glycoprotein in PBMCs of healthy volunteers.\nThis may represent a second mechanism for the drug–herb interactions seen in clinical practice and account for the discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo data.\nSince P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 have distinct though overlapping substrates, patients receiving drugs, which are P-glycoprotein substrates should be warned against self-medication with SJW as clinically significant drug interactions may occur.\n","label":[[0,20,"Herb name"],[170,173,"Herb name"],[248,257,"Drug"],[262,274,"Drug"],[306,323,"Target"],[488,505,"Study"],[563,573,"Drug"],[578,589,"Drug"],[702,716,"Target"],[743,748,"Herb name"],[829,836,"Pathology"],[873,877,"Herb name"],[885,892,"Amount"],[892,910,"Frequency"],[914,922,"Duration"],[928,930,"Cohort"],[947,949,"Cohort"],[982,999,"Target"],[1067,1103,"Parameter"],[1570,1580,"Drug"],[1743,1747,"Herb name"],[1855,1859,"Herb name"],[1869,1909,"Target"],[2022,2031,"Drug"],[2129,2145,"Target"],[2148,2153,"Parameter"],[2157,2164,"Pathology"],[2347,2361,"Target"],[2365,2372,"Target"],[2454,2468,"Target"],[2525,2529,"Herb name"]],"Comments":[]}
