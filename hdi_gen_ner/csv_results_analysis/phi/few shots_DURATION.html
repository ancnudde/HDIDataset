      <td>used the duration of QRS interval prolongation, ventricular precontraction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation as markers of arrhythmia to study the effects of C. pinnatifida Bunge (Shanzha) extract on digoxin-induced arrhythmias, and the results showed that the ventricular arrhythmias in the digoxin-induced experimental group of rats all decreased after the administration of C. pinnatifida Bunge (Shanzha) extract, indicating that the flavonoid glycoside and flavane polymers in C. pinnatifida Bunge (Shanzha) extract can antagonize digoxin-induced arrhythmias (Li and Huang, 2016), which may be related to their ability to dilate blood vessels, lower blood pressure, slow down the heart rhythm, and improve the cardiovascular system (Zhang et al., 2021).</td>
