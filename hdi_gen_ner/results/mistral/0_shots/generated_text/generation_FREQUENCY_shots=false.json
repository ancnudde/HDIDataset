Selective Antagonist of the \u03b11-Adrenergic Receptor\n\nIntroduction\nThe \u03b11-adrenergic receptor (\u03b11-AR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in the regulation of various physiological processes, including blood pressure, heart rate, and glandular secretion (1, 2). ICI 118,551 (phenylephrine 1-[2-chloroethyl]-N-[2-[2-methoxyethyl]-1-propyl]-N-[2-[methoxyethyl]-1-propyl]-1-naphthalenamine) is a potent and selective antagonist of the \u03b11-AR (3, 4). In this article, we will discuss the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ICI 118,551.\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption\nAfter intravenous administration, ICI 118,551 exhibits a rapid and complete absorption (5). The plasma concentration-time profile shows a biphasic pattern, with a rapid initial distribution phase followed by a slower elimination phase (6).\n\nDistribution\nICI 118,551 is highly lipophilic and binds extensively to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin (7). The protein binding is reversible, and the unbound fraction in plasma is approximately 0.01% (8). The volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) is estimated to be around 1.5 L/kg (9).\n\nMetabolism\nICI 118,551 undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, primarily through hydroxylation and deethylation reactions (10). The major metabolites are 6-hydroxy-ICI 118,551 and 6-deethyl-ICI 118,551 (11). These metabolites are further conjugated with glucuronic acid", {}]], [674, "Increasing use of medicinal herbs as nutritional supplements and traditional medicines for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and malaria fever with conventional drugs poses possibilities of herb\u2013drug interactions ( In vitro inhibition of eight major   Mangifera indica moderately inhibited  Potential for clinically important     Funding information  This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not\u2010for\u2010profit sectors Management of chronic diseases is burdensome to patients (Eton et\u00a0al., 2013; \u00d8rtenblad, Meillier, & J\u00f8nsson, 2017) who tend to seek alternative remedies to conventional medications that may supposedly provide cure or offer safe use (Yarney et\u00a0al., 2013; Joeliantina, Agil, Qomaruddin, Jonosewojo, & Kusnanto, 2016) This self\u2010medication practice is common among chronically ill patients or patients with terminal diseases (Bodenheimer, Lorig, Holman, & Grumbach, 2002; Hasan, Ahmed, Bukhari, & Loon, 2009), and the major culprit in this group of patients are dietary supplements and herbal medicines (Gardiner, Graham, Legedza, Eisenberg, & Phillips, 2006; Gardiner, Phillips, & Shaughnessy, 2008).", [" {\n\"Mangifera indica\": [1],\n\"eight major\": [1],\n\"in vitro inhibition\": [1],\n\"Potential for clinically important interactions\": [1],\n\"funding agencies\": [1],\n\"public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors\": [1],\n\"management of chronic diseases\": [1],\n\"patients\": [5],\n\"chronically ill patients\": [2],\n\"patients with terminal diseases\": [1],\n\"dietary supplements\": [1],\n\"herbal medicines\": [1],\n\"conventional medications\": [1],\n\"alternative remedies\": [1],\n\"Eton, et al.\": [1],\n\"2013\": [1],\n\"\u00d8rtenblad, Meillier, & J\u00f8nsson\": [1],\n\"2017\": [1],\n\"Yarney, et al.\": [1],\n\"2013\": [1],\n\"Joeliantina, Agil, Qomaruddin, Jonosewojo, & Kusnanto\": [1],\n\"2016\": [1],\n\"Bodenheimer, Lorig, Holman, & Grumbach\": [1],\n\"2002\": [1],\n\"Hasan, Ahmed, Bukhari, & Loon\": [1],\n\"2009\": [1]\n}", {"Pathology": ["diabetes", "hypertension", "hyperlipidemia", "malaria fever"], "Study": ["In vitro"], "Herb name": ["Mangifera indica"]}]], [675, "Others such as Alstonia boonei, Bauhinia monandra, and Picralima nitida are frequently used in sub\u2010Saharan Africa and India in the management of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, peptic ulcer, and cancer, as antimalarials and antimicrobials and other minor ailments (Mahomoodally, 2013; Ezuruike & Prieto, 2014; Iwu, 2014).", [" {\"FREQUENCY\": [\"Alstonia boonei\", \"Bauhinia monandra\", \"Picralima nitida\", \"hypertension\", \"diabetes\", \"asthma\", \"peptic ulcer\", \"cancer\", \"antimalarials\", \"antimicrobials\"]}", {"Herb name": ["Alstonia boonei", "Bauhinia monandra", "Picralima nitida"], "Pathology": ["hypertension", "diabetes", "asthma", "peptic ulcer", "cancer"]}]], [676, "These isoenzymes are responsible for the metabolism of over 70% of prescription and over\u2010the\u2010counter medications (Rendic & Guengerich, 2014).", [" {\"Isozymes\": [\"These isozymes\"]}\n{\"Percentage\": [\"are responsible for the metabolism of over 70% of prescription and over-the-counter medications\"]}\n{\"Prescription medications\": [\"prescription medications\"], \"Over-the-counter medications\": [\"over-the-counter medications\"]}\n{\"Rendic\": [\"& Guengerich, 2014\"]}", {}]], [677, "Little is known of the effect of most tropical medicinal herbs on the metabolic capacity of CYP isoenzymes.", [" {\"CYP isoenzymes\": [1]}\n\nThe cytochrome P450 (CYP) system is a major biotransformation system responsible for the metabolism of xenobiotics in the liver and intestines.
