The safety and efficacy of black cohosh have been the subject of extensive research.

She required hospitalization for liver function tests and supportive care.\n\n3.

Overview\n\nArtemisia annua L. (Asteraceae), also known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America [1, 2]. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 2,000 years due to its antipyretic, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory properties [1, 3]. The active components of A. annua are primarily sesquiterpene lactones, including artemisinin and its derivatives [1, 4].\n\nChemistry and Pharmacology of Artemisinin\n\nArtemisinin (Qinghaosu) is the most well-known active compound in A. annua [1, 5]. It is a sesquiterpene lactone with a unique peroxide bridge, which is responsible for its pharmacological properties [1, 6]. Artemisinin and its derivatives exhibit potent antimalarial activity against both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax [1, 7].\n\nThe mechanism of action of artemisinin involves the formation of free radicals, which damage the malarial parasite's membranes [1, 8]. Artemisinin is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body [1, 9]. It is metabolized primarily in the liver, and its major metabolites include dihydroartemisinin, artesene, and artemisinic acid [1, 10].\n\nMedicinal Uses of Artemisia annua and Artemisinin\n\nArtemisia annua and artemisinin have been used to treat various diseases, including malaria, fever, and inflammation [1, 11]. Artemisinin-based combination therapies, such as artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine, are widely used in the treatment of malaria [1, 12].\n\nArtemisia annua and artemisinin have also shown potential in the treatment", {}]], [674, "Increasing use of medicinal herbs as nutritional supplements and traditional medicines for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and malaria fever with conventional drugs poses possibilities of herb\u2013drug interactions ( In vitro inhibition of eight major   Mangifera indica moderately inhibited  Potential for clinically important     Funding information  This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not\u2010for\u2010profit sectors Management of chronic diseases is burdensome to patients (Eton et\u00a0al., 2013; \u00d8rtenblad, Meillier, & J\u00f8nsson, 2017) who tend to seek alternative remedies to conventional medications that may supposedly provide cure or offer safe use (Yarney et\u00a0al., 2013; Joeliantina, Agil, Qomaruddin, Jonosewojo, & Kusnanto, 2016) This self\u2010medication practice is common among chronically ill patients or patients with terminal diseases (Bodenheimer, Lorig, Holman, & Grumbach, 2002; Hasan, Ahmed, Bukhari, & Loon, 2009), and the major culprit in this group of patients are dietary supplements and herbal medicines (Gardiner, Graham, Legedza, Eisenberg, & Phillips, 2006; Gardiner, Phillips, & Shaughnessy, 2008).", [" {\"EXTRACTION PROCESS\": [],\n \"Mangifera indica\": [\"Mangifera indica moderately inhibited\"],\n \"Mangifera indica L.\": [],\n \"potential for clinically important interactions\": [\"potential for clinically important interactions\"],\n \"funding agencies\": [\"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies\"],\n \"public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors\": [\"in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors\"],\n \"chronic diseases\": [\"management of chronic diseases\"],\n \"patients\": [\"patients who tend to seek alternative remedies to conventional medications\", \"patients or patients with terminal diseases\"],\n \"alternative remedies\": [\"alternative remedies to conventional medications\"],\n \"conventional medications\": [\"who tend to seek alternative remedies to conventional medications that may supposedly provide cure or offer safe use\"],\n \"dietary supplements\": [\"and the major culprit in this group of patients are dietary supplements and herbal medicines\"],\n \"herbal medicines\": [\"and the major culprit in this group of patients are dietary supplements and herbal medicines\"]}", {"Pathology": ["diabetes", "hypertension", "hyperlipidemia", "malaria fever"], "Study": ["In vitro"], "Herb name": ["Mangifera indica"]}]], [675, "Others such as Alstonia boonei, Bauhinia monandra, and Picralima nitida are frequently used in sub\u2010Saharan Africa and India in the management of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, peptic ulcer, and cancer, as antimalarials and antimicrobials and other minor ailments (Mahomoodally, 2013; Ezuruike & Prieto, 2014; Iwu, 2014).", [" {\"EXTRACTION PROCESS\": [],\n \"PLANTS\": [\"Alstonia boonei\", \"Bauhinia monandra\", \"Picralima nitida\"],\n \"DISEASES\": [\"chronic diseases\", \"hypertension\", \"diabetes\", \"asthma\", \"peptic ulcer\", \"cancer\"],\n \"USES\": [\"management of\", \"antimalarials and antimicrobials\", \"other minor ailments\"]}", {"Herb name": ["Alstonia boonei", "Bauhinia monandra", "Picralima nitida"], "Pathology": ["hypertension", "diabetes", "asthma", "peptic ulcer", "cancer"]}]], [676, "These isoenzymes are responsible for the metabolism of over 70% of prescription and over\u2010the\u2010counter medications (Rendic & Guengerich, 2014).", [" {\"ISOENZYMES\": [\"isoenzymes\"], \"PERCENTAGE\": [\"over 70%\", \"prescription and over-the-counter medications\"]}", {}]], [677, "Little is known of the effect of most tropical medicinal herbs on the metabolic capacity of CYP isoenzymes.", [" {\"CYP isoenzymes\": []}\n\nThe following is a summary of the pharmacological actions of some commonly used tropical medicinal herbs on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system:\n\n1.
