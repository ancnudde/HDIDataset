One of the major challenges in the management of type 2 diabetes is the presence of drug\u2013drug interactions (DDIs) that can affect the efficacy and safety of antidiabetic medications. Gliclazide, a second-generation sulfonylurea, is widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes due to its high therapeutic index and low incidence of side effects. However, gliclazide is known to undergo extensive metabolism, mainly through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, particularly CYP2C9. Herbal medicines, such as St John's wort, are commonly used in the community and have been reported to interact with gliclazide through inhibition of CYP2C9. In this study, we investigated the effect of St John's wort on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of gliclazide in healthy volunteers.
