One of the most commonly used herbal medicines is St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). However, the interaction between St John's wort and antidiabetic drugs, particularly gliclazide, can affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gliclazide.\n\nGo to: Pharmacokinetic Interactions\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions between St John's wort and gliclazide have been reported. The primary enzyme responsible for gliclazide metabolism is cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). St John's wort is known to inhibit CYP2C9, leading to increased gliclazide concentrations in the blood.\n\nGo to: Pharmacodynamic Interactions\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions between St John's wort and gliclazide have also been reported. St John's wort may enhance the insulin-sensitizing effect of gliclazide, leading to a potential additive effect. However, this interaction may also increase the risk of hypoglycemia.\n\nGo to: Genetic Factors\n\nGenetic factors, particularly CYP2C9 genotype, can influence the interaction between St John's wort and gliclazide. Individuals with the CYP2C9*2 allele may be more susceptible to increased gliclazide concentrations and the risk of hypoglycemia.\n\nGo to: Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the use of St John's wort in diabetes management can interact with gliclazide, leading to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. The CYP2C9 genotype may also influence the interaction.
