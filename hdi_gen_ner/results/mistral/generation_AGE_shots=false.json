Food intake delays the absorption, with a Tmax of approximately 6 hours [1].\n\nDistribution:\nFingolimod is highly lipophilic and distributes extensively into tissues, with a volume of distribution (Vd) of approximately 10 L/kg [1, 3]. It is also known to cross the blood-brain barrier [1, 4].\n\nMetabolism:\nFingolimod undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, primarily by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 [1, 5]. Its major metabolites include metabolites M1, M2, and M3 [1, 6].\n\nElimination:\nThe elimination half-life (t1/2) of fingolimod is approximately 12 hours [1, 3]. It is primarily eliminated via the feces, with approximately 80% of the administered dose excreted unchanged [1].\n\nDrug-drug interactions:\nFingolimod is a substrate of CYP3A4, and its metabolism can be affected by drugs that inhibit or induce this enzyme [1, 5]. For instance, co-administration of fingolimod with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, can increase fingolimod plasma concentrations [1, 7].\n\nPharmacogenetics:\nGenetic variations in CYP3A4 and other metabolizing enzymes can influence fingolimod metabolism and, consequently, its pharmacodynamics [1, 8].
