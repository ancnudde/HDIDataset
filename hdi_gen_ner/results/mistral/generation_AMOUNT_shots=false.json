We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to May 2020. We included studies reporting genetic variants and their effects on the PK and PD of statins. We identified 112 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that genetic variants in ABCG2, SLCO1B1, and CYP3A4 genes significantly affected the PK and PD of statins. For example, the ABCG2 gene variant influences the intestinal absorption of statins, while the SLCO1B1 gene variant affects the hepatic uptake and renal excretion. The CYP3A4 gene variant influences the metabolism of statins. These findings may help clinicians to personalize statin therapy based on the genetic information of patients.\"\n\nEntities:\n\n1. \"AMOUNT\": [\"112\"], \"Studies\": \"\"\n2. \"X.

Rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, doxorubicin, doxorubicin + curcumin (low dose), doxorubicin + curcumin (high dose), and curcumin. Doxorubicin was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight for 4 consecutive days. Curcumin was administered orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight for 14 days. Echocardiography was performed before and after treatment to assess the cardiac function. Serum biochemical markers, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and total antioxidant status (TAS) were measured. Histopathological examination was carried out to assess the cardiac damage.\n\nResults:\nThe results showed that doxorubicin significantly decreased the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (FS) compared to the control group (p < 0.01). Doxorubicin also increased the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine (Cr), and MDA, and decreased the TAS level (p < 0.001). Histopathological examination revealed cardiac damage in the doxorubicin group. Curcumin treatment reversed the doxorubicin-induced decrease in LVEF and FS (p < 0.01). Curcumin also decreased the serum levels of AST, ALT, and Cr, and increased", {}]], [460, "However, there is hardly any data on the pharmacological safety of these two herbal medicines.", [" \"Two

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of statins are influenced by genetic variations, which can lead to interindividual differences in drug response. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the genetic determinants of statin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with a focus on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and transporters involved in statin metabolism and disposition. We also discuss the clinical implications of these genetic variations and provide an outlook on future research directions.\n\nCYP3A4, a major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of most statins, is subject to genetic polymorphisms. The CYP3A5 gene, which encodes another isoform of CYP3A enzyme, also exhibits genetic variability. Polymorphisms in the ABCG2 gene, which encodes a transporter involved in the biliary excretion of statins, have also been reported to affect statin disposition.\n\nThe impact of these genetic variations on statin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can lead to altered drug metabolism, increased or decreased drug exposure, and variable drug response. For example, the CYP3A4*22 polymorphism has been shown to increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy, while the CYP3A5*3 allele has been associated with decreased statin clearance and increased statin exposure.\n\nIn conclusion, genetic variations play a significant role in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of statins. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of these genetic determinants is crucial for optimizing statin therapy and minimizing the risk of adverse effects.\"\n\nCited Entities:\n\n1.
