The interaction between TCM formulations and digoxin may be mediated through the inhibition of the hepatic metabolism of digoxin by certain components in TCM formulations. For instance, baicalin, a major active component in Scutellaria baicalensis, has been reported to inhibit the metabolism of digoxin in rats, leading to an increase in digoxin plasma concentration and an enhanced risk of digoxin toxicity.\n\nB. Another possible mechanism of interaction is through the modulation of ion channels. Digoxin exerts its therapeutic effects by binding to the sodium-potassium ATPase (Na+,K+-ATPase) in cardiac myocytes, leading to an increase in intracellular sodium ions and a subsequent increase in calcium ions, which results in an increase in contractility and a decrease in heart rate. Some TCM formulations, such as those containing ginseng or foxglove, contain compounds that may also affect ion channels. For example, ginsenosides, the active components of Panax ginseng, have been reported to inhibit the Na+,K+-ATPase, which may enhance the effects of digoxin and increase the risk of digoxin toxicity.\n\nC. Additionally, some TCM formulations may contain herbs that have a diuretic effect, such as Dioscorea opposita and Rheum palmatum. Diuretics can increase the renal clearance of digoxin, leading to a decrease in digoxin plasma concentration and a potential reduction in therapeutic efficacy.\n\nD. The interaction between TCM formulations and digoxin may also depend on the dose and duration of administration. For example, a single dose of a TCM formulation may not significantly affect digoxin plasma concentration, but chronic administration of the TCM formulation may lead to a more pronounced interaction due to the accumulation of the inhibitory components in the body.\n\nE.

Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats by streptozotocin injection. The rats were divided into four groups: control, diabetic, rosuvastatin-treated diabetic, and metformin-treated diabetic. Rosuvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) and metformin (100 mg/kg/day) were administered orally for 12 weeks. Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function. Cardiac tissue was collected for histological analysis.\n\nResults:\nDiabetes led to significant cardiac remodeling, as evidenced by increased left ventricular mass, left ventricular wall thickness, and left ventricular chamber diameter. Rosuvastatin and metformin treatment prevented these changes.\n\nRosuvastatin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in serum glucose levels and an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Metformin treatment led to a significant decrease in serum glucose levels.\n\nConclusion:\nOur findings suggest that rosuvastatin and metformin have protective effects against cardiac remodeling in diabetic rats. Rosuvastatin's lipid-lowering effect may contribute to its cardioprotective properties, while metformin's effect on glucose metabolism may also play a role.\",\n\n\"COHORTS\": [\n{\"COHORT\": {\"NAME\": \"Wist", {}]], [259, "In Stage 2 77 additional participants were randomized to either 1,200 mg S. frutescens or placebo.", [" {\"COHORT\": \"77 additional participants, 1,200 mg S. frutescens group, placebo group\"}", {"Amount": ["1,200 mg"], "Herb name": ["S. frutescens"]}]], [260, "More than 50% of adults in KwaZulu-Natal attending public sector facilities for ART initiation disclose using TCAM [10], and similar levels of TCAM use by HIV positive individuals may occur worldwide [11].", [" [\n{\"COHORT\": \"more than 50% of adults in KwaZulu-Natal\"},\n\"KwaZulu-Natal\",\n\"adults\",\n\n{\"COHORT\": \"attending public sector facilities for ART initiation\"},\n\"public sector facilities\",\n\n{\"ENTITY\": \"TCAM\"},\n\"ART initiation\"\n],\n\n[\n{\"COHORT\": \"and similar levels of TCAM use by HIV positive individuals\"},\n\"similar levels\",\n\"HIV positive individuals\",\n\n{\"ENTITY\": \"TCAM\"},\n\"worldwide\"\n]", {"Drug": ["ART"], "Pathology": ["HIV positive"]}]], [261, "With respect to the MOS-HIV, failure differences were found between placebo and 1200 mg, favouring the 1200mg group.", [" {\"MOS-HIV\": \"a study or trial, specifically the MOS-HIV study or trial\"}\n\nThe following format must be followed:\n{\"ENTITY\": \"Description of the entity\"}\n\nWith respect to the MOS-HIV study, failure differences were found between placebo and 1200 mg, favoring the 1200mg group.\n\nNo additional information provided, so the other fields are left empty.", {"Amount": ["1200 mg", "1200mg"]}]], [262, "On serial electrocardiograms the PR interval, QRS duration and corrected QT interval (QTc) were similar in both arms (S2 Table).", [" {\n\"PR INTERVAL\": \"The PR interval\",\n\"QRS DURATION\": \"The QRS duration\",\n\"QTc INTERVAL\": \"the corrected QT interval (QTc)\"\n}\n\n(No information about the cohort was provided in this text)", {"Parameter": ["the PR interval", "QRS duration", "corrected QT interval (QTc)"], "Study": ["both arms"]}]], [263, "Abbreviations: HDL (high density lipoprotein); LDL (low density lipoprotein) *P-value for interaction effect of groups over time.", [" [{\"COHORT\": \"healthy volunteers and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)\"},\n \"HDL\": \"high density lipoprotein\",\n \"LDL\": \"low density lipoprotein\",\n \"CAD\": \"coronary artery disease\",\n \"groups\": \"\",\n \"time\": \"\"}\n]\n\nThis format provides the description of the cohort and the abbreviations HDL and LDL.

Rosuvastatin and metformin also significantly reduced the serum lipid profile, cardiac troponin I, and creatinine kinase-MB levels.

Histopathological examination was carried out to assess the cardiac remodeling. Rosuvastatin and metformin significantly improved the cardiac function as evidenced by an increase in ejection fraction and fractional shortening. Rosuvastatin and metformin also significantly reduced the serum lipid profile, cardiac troponin I, and creatinine kinase-MB levels.
