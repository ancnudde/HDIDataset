Absorption:\nThe absorption of drugs can be influenced by various factors, including pH, enzymes, and transporters. For instance, the presence of food can affect the rate and extent of drug absorption.\n\n2. Distribution:\nDrug distribution is influenced by factors such as protein binding, lipid solubility, and tissue distribution. For example, highly protein-bound drugs may have limited distribution to certain tissues, while lipid-soluble drugs can easily penetrate cell membranes.\n\n3. Metabolism:\nDrug metabolism is the process by which the body transforms drugs into metabolites, which can be excreted from the body. This process is primarily carried out by the liver, and various enzymes play a role in drug metabolism. For instance, cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of many drugs.\n\n4. Excretion:\nDrug excretion is the process by which the body eliminates drugs and their metabolites from the body. This can occur through various routes, including renal excretion (via the kidneys) and biliary excretion (via the liver).\n\n5. Pharmacodynamic interactions:\nPharmacodynamic interactions occur when two or more drugs act on the same biological target, resulting in enhanced or reduced effects. For example, the combination of two drugs with similar mechanisms of action can lead to additive or synergistic effects, while the combination of two drugs with opposing mechanisms of action can lead to antagonistic effects.\n\n6.

The unique genetic makeup of these populations, coupled with differences in lifestyle and dietary habits, can significantly influence drug metabolism and response [3,4]. Understanding the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of drugs in ethnic populations is crucial for optimizing drug therapy and minimizing adverse effects [5]. In this review, we will focus on the PK and PD of drugs in Asian populations, with a particular emphasis on Chinese, Japanese, and Korean populations.\n\n......\n\nPharmacokinetics\n......\n\nAbsorption\n......\n\nThe absorption of drugs can be influenced by various factors, including gastric pH, intestinal motility, and intestinal metabolizing enzymes [6]. For example, the absorption of pravastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is influenced by the polymorphism of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 gene [7]. The OATP1B1 gene encodes a transporter protein that plays a crucial role in the absorption of pravastatin and other organic anions [8]. The CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles, which are more common in Asians than in Caucasians, have been shown to result in decreased pravastatin clearance and increased bioavailability [9].\n\n......\n\nDistribution\n......\n\nThe distribution of drugs in the body is influenced by various factors, including protein binding, volume of distribution, and tissue distribution [10]. For example, warfarin, an anticoagulant, is highly protein-bound, and the binding affinity can vary between different ethnic groups [11]. The binding affinity of warfarin to albumin is lower in Asians than in Caucasians, resulting in a larger free fraction of warfarin in the plasma [12]. This difference in protein binding can lead to increased warfarin sensitivity and an increased risk", {}]], [674, "Increasing use of medicinal herbs as nutritional supplements and traditional
