Zhang, Y. Liu, J. Wang\n\nJournal: Pharmacology Research\n\nAbstract:\nThis study investigates the interactions between ibuprofen and metformin, focusing on their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. Ibuprofen inhibits the renal clearance of metformin, leading to an increase in metformin plasma concentration. This interaction is mediated by organic anion transport proteins (OATPs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). The clinical implications of this interaction include an increased risk of lactic acidosis and gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nText:\n\nIbuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is commonly used for the treatment of pain and inflammation. Metformin, an antidiabetic medication, is primarily used for the management of type 2 diabetes.\n\nFREQUENCY: Ibuprofen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, treatment, pain, inflammation\n\nThe concomitant use of ibuprofen and metformin has been reported to result in pharmacological interactions. Pharmacodynamic interactions between these two drugs have been extensively studied, but pharmacokinetic interactions have received less attention.\n\nFREQUENCY: ibuprofen and metformin, pharmacological interactions, pharmacodynamic interactions, pharmacokinetic interactions\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions between ibuprofen and metformin have been observed primarily in the renal clearance of metformin. Ibuprofen inhibits the renal clearance of metformin, leading to an increase in metformin plasma concentration.\n\nFREQUENCY: ibuprofen, metformin, renal clearance, plasma concentration\n\nThis interaction is mediated by organic anion transport proteins (OATPs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). OATPs are responsible for the uptake of organic anions from the renal tubules, while GSTs catalyze the conjugation of", {}]], [181, "3; Table 8) in a manner consistent with the literature (Ring et

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and diuretics are commonly used classes of antihypertensive drugs. CCBs, which include nifedipine, amlodipine, and verapamil, act by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions into the myoplasmic sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac and smooth muscle cells. ACE inhibitors, such as enalapril and lisinopril, inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thereby reducing the vasoconstriction and increasing the production of bradykinin, a vasodilator. ARBs, including losartan and valsartan, block the angiotensin II receptor, leading to vasodilation and decreased production of aldosterone. Diuretics, such as furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide, increase the excretion of sodium and water, thereby reducing the total body fluid volume and blood pressure.

Fentanyl is a potent agonist of \u03bc-opioid receptors (MORs), and its PK and PD properties are crucial for understanding its therapeutic and adverse effects.\n\nText:\n\nFentanyl is a synthetic opioid agonist, primarily acting on \u03bc-opioid receptors (MORs). It is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than sufentanil.\n\nPharmacokinetics:\n\nAbsorption: Fentanyl is available in various formulations, including transdermal patches, buccal tablets, sublingual tablets, and intravenous (IV) injections. Transdermal patches are the most commonly used route for chronic pain management. After application, fentanyl is absorbed through the skin and into the systemic circulation.\n\nDistribution: Fentanyl has a high protein binding capacity, with approximately 85% binding to plasma proteins, mainly \u03b11-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Its volume of distribution is approximately 3-4 L/kg.\n\nMetabolism: Fentanyl undergoes N-dealkylation by CYP3A4 to form norfentanyl, which is then conjugated with glucuronide to form norfentanyl glucuronide (NFG). NFG is the major metabolite of fentanyl and is pharmacologically active.\n\nExcretion: Fentanyl and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. The elimination half-life of fentanyl is approximately 18 hours, while that of norfentanyl is around 24 hours.\n\nPharmac", {}]], [298, "[36].", [" \"FREQUENCY\": []\n\nPharmacology of Ibuprofen and Naproxen: Mechanisms of Action and Clinical Applications\n\nIbuprofen and naproxen are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) widely used for their analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nMechanisms of Action:\n1.

Its therapeutic effects are primarily attributed to its inhibitory action on cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes.\n\n1. Cyclooxygenase (COX):\nThe COX enzymes are responsible for the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, which are mediators of inflammation and pain. Ibuprofen inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms, leading to a reduction in prostaglandin production and subsequent relief of pain and inflammation.\n\n2. Prostaglandins:\nProstaglandins are lipid mediators that play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including inflammation, pain perception, and platelet aggregation. They are synthesized from arachidonic acid through the action of COX enzymes.\n\n3. COX-1 and COX-2:\nCOX-1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, and is responsible for the production of prostaglandins involved in maintaining homeostasis. COX-2, on the other hand, is an inducible isoform, which is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli and is primarily responsible for the production of prostaglandins involved in inflammation and pain.\n\n4. Mechanisms of Action:\nThe primary mechanism of action of ibuprofen is its inhibitory effect on COX enzymes, leading to a decrease in prostaglandin production. Additionally, ibuprofen has been shown to exhibit other pharmacological actions, including inhibition of leukotriene synthesis, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and modulation of cytokine production.\n\n5. Clinical Applications:\nIbuprofen is widely used for the treatment of various conditions, including pain, inflammation, and fever.

highly addictive opioid drug that is synthesized from morphine.\n\n\"Fentanyl\": Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.\n\n\"Oxycodone\" (Oxycodone hydrochloride): Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid that is derived from thebaine, an opioid alkaloid found in the opium poppy.\n\n\"Hydromorphone\" (Hydromorphone hydrochloride): Hydromorphone is a semi-synthetic opioid that is derived from morphine.\n\n\"Opioid receptors\" (\u03bc-opioid receptors, \u03b4-opioid receptors, \u03ba-opioid receptors): Opioid receptors are a class of G

Metformin, an antidiabetic medication, is primarily used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nCase Report:\nA 55-year-old female patient with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus was prescribed ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily for pain management and metformin 1000 mg twice daily for glycemic control. After one week of concomitant therapy, the patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of lactic acidosis.\n\nLaboratory findings revealed a serum lactate level of 4.5 mmol/L (normal range: 0.5-2.2 mmol/L), a serum bicarbonate level of 15 mEq/L (normal range: 22-26 mEq/L), and a serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6-1.3 mg/dL). The patient was treated with intravenous fluids and bicarbonate, and her symptoms improved.\n\nThe possible pharmacological interaction between ibuprofen and metformin has been reported in previous studies.

The patient presented with symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated creatinine level, suggesting renal impairment. The patient's ibuprofen and metformin doses were reduced, and her symptoms resolved.\n\nDiscussion: The mechanisms underlying the interaction between ibuprofen and metformin are not fully understood. However, it is believed that ibuprofen may inhibit the renal tubular secretion of metformin, leading to increased metformin levels and potential renal toxicity.\n\nConclusion: This case report highlights the importance of being aware of potential pharmacological interactions between commonly used medications, such as ibuprofen and metformin.

Metformin is an oral antidiabetic medication, primarily used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nCase Report: A 58-year-old female patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain. She was prescribed ibuprofen 400 mg every 6 hours for pain relief. Concurrently, she was taking metformin 1000 mg twice daily for glycemic control.\n\nPharmacokinetics: Ibuprofen: The half-life of ibuprofen is approximately 2 hours. Metformin: The half-life of metformin is around 6 hours.\n\nInteraction: The patient experienced an unexpected decrease in her blood glucose levels after taking ibuprofen and metformin together. This interaction is believed to be due to the inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 by ibuprofen, which results in increased metformin bioavailability and subsequent increased risk of hypoglycemia.\n\nDiscussion: The interaction between ibuprofen and metformin highlights the importance of monitoring patients taking both medications for potential adverse effects.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic relapsing brain disorder characterized by the following:\n   - Compulsive drug-seeking behavior\n   - Loss of control over drug intake\n   - Craving for the drug\n   - Negative physiological and psychological effects\n\n2. Opioid receptors (\u03bc-opioid receptor, \u03b4-opioid receptor, \u03ba-opioid receptor) are the primary targets for pharmacological interventions in OUD.\n\n3. Opioid agonists (buprenorphine, methadone, fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone) are used for the treatment of OUD.\n\n4. Opioid agonists bind to opioid receptors and produce analgesic effects, reduce cravings, and block the effects of illicit opioids.\n\n5. Opioid antagonists (naloxone, naltrexone) are used for the treatment of opioid overdose and as a maintenance therapy for OUD.\n\n6. Opioid antagonists block the effects of opioid agonists by binding to opioid receptors and preventing agonist binding.\n\n7. Opioid partial agonists (buprenorphine) have a lower potential for abuse and dependence compared to full opioid agonists.\n\n8. Opioid receptor modulators (G protein-biased ligands) have the potential to produce therapeutic effects without the addictive properties of opioid agonists.\n\n9. Combination therapies (methadone and buprenorphine, buprenorphine and naloxone) are used for the treatment of OUD and have shown to be effective in reducing opioid cravings and improving patient outcomes.\n", {}]], [874, "Diabetes is a complex condition with a variety of causes and pathophysiologies.", [" \"Diabetes\": [\"Diabetes is\"]\n\n\"Condition\": [\"complex condition\"]\n\n\"Variety\": [\"variety of causes and pathophysiologies\"]\n\n\"Causes\": []\n\n\"Pathophysiologies\": []\n\n---\n\nThe most common form of diabetes, type 2 diabetes, is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.\n\n\"Type 2 diabetes\": [\"Type 2 diabetes\"]\n\n\"Characterized by\": [\"is characterized by\"]\n\n\"Insulin resistance\": [\"insulin resistance\"]\n\n\"Relative insulin deficiency\": [\"relative insulin deficiency\"]\n\n---\n\nInsulin is a peptide hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas.
