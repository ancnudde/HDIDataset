The pharmacological activities of Radix Isatidis have been extensively studied, revealing its antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties.\n\nThe main active components of Radix Isatidis include indigo naturalis, isatidin, and anthocyanins. Indigo naturalis, also known as isatan, is a glycoside that is responsible for the blue color of the plant. It has been shown to exhibit antiviral, antibacterial, and antitumor activities. Isatidin, a flavonoid, has been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. Anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid pigment, contribute to the plant's color and have been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nThe mechanisms of action of these active components involve various pathways, including inhibition of viral replication, modulation of the immune system, and antioxidant activity. For instance, indigo naturalis has been shown to inhibit the replication of influenza A virus by blocking the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Isatidin has been reported to enhance the production of interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-2, which are important cytokines involved in the immune response. Anthocyanins have been shown to scavenge free radicals and reduce oxidative stress.\n\nIn conclusion, Radix Isatidis, the root of Isatis indigotica Fort.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors:\nSGLT2 inhibitors are a class of antidiabetic drugs that work by inhibiting the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the proximal tubules of the kidney, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and reduced reabsorption of glucose by the kidneys.\n\n3. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists:\nGLP-1 receptor agonists are a class of antidiabetic drugs that mimic the actions of incretin hormones, such as GLP-1, which stimulate insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon secretion, thereby improving glycemic control.\n\n4. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors:\nDPP-4 inhibitors are a class of antidiabetic drugs that inhibit the enzyme DPP-4, which is responsible for the degradation of incretin hormones, such as GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), thereby increasing their levels and improving insulin secretion and glucose metabolism.\n\n5. Insulin:\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood glucose levels. It promotes the uptake and storage of glucose by the liver, muscles, and adipose tissue, and inhibits the release of glucose by the liver.\n\n6.
