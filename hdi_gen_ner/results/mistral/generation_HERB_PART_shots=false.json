These compounds have been used for the treatment of various cardiac conditions, including heart failure and atrial fibrillation, due to their positive inotropic and chronotropic effects.\n\nMechanisms of Action:\nThe primary mechanism of action for cardiac glycosides involves inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump (Na+,K+-ATPase) in the myocardial cell membrane. This leads to an increase in intracellular sodium ions, which in turn triggers an influx of calcium ions through the sodium-calcium exchange mechanism. The increased intracellular calcium ion concentration results in increased contractility and conduction velocity in the heart.\n\nTherapeutic Uses:\nDigoxin and digitoxin are primarily used in the treatment of heart failure, particularly in cases where the ejection fraction is below 40%. They have also been used to manage atrial fibrillation, as they can help restore normal sinus rhythm. Additionally, these cardiac glycosides have been used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and to prevent premature atrial contractions.\n\nToxicity:\nDespite their therapeutic benefits, cardiac glycosides can be toxic at high doses. Digoxin toxicity is characterized by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and cardiac arrhythmias. Digitoxin toxicity can manifest as similar symptoms, but may also include symptoms such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Factors that increase the risk of toxicity include advanced age, renal insufficiency, and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nIn conclusion, digoxin and digitoxin are cardiac glycosides derived from the foxglove plant that have been used for the treatment of various cardiac conditions due to their positive inotropic and chronotropic effects.

R. Br. is a medicinal plant used in traditional South African herbal medicine for the treatment of various diseases, including inflammatory conditions. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of the ethanolic extract of S. frutescens (ESf) using in vitro and in vivo models. The 50% ethanolic extract of S. frutescens was prepared and subjected to phytochemical screening. The extract was then evaluated for its anti-inflammatory activity using the nitric oxide (NO) production inhibition assay, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced paw edema model, and carrageenan-induced paw edema model. The results showed that ESf significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In the LPS-induced paw edema model, ESf significantly (p < 0.05) reduced paw edema volume. In the carrageenan-induced paw edema model, ESf significantly (p < 0.05) reduced paw edema volume and increased plethysmographic pressure. These findings suggest that ESf possesses significant anti-inflammatory activity.\n\n{\"Herb Part\": []}\n\nThe article does not provide any information about the specific parts of Sutherlandia frutescens used in the study.",

These compounds have been used for the treatment of various cardiac conditions, including heart failure and atrial fibrillation, due to their positive inotropic and chronotropic effects.\n\nMechanisms of Action:\nThe primary mechanism of action for cardiac glycosides involves inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump (Na+,K+-ATPase) in the myocardial cell membrane. This leads to an increase in intracellular sodium ions, which in turn triggers an influx of calcium ions through the sodium-calcium exchange mechanism. The increased intracellular calcium ion concentration results in increased contractility and conduction velocity in the heart.\n\nTherapeutic Uses:\nDigoxin and digitoxin are primarily used in the treatment of heart failure, particularly in cases where the ejection fraction is below 40%. They have also been used to manage atrial fibrillation, as they can help restore normal sinus rhythm. Additionally, these cardiac glycosides have been used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and to prevent premature atrial contractions.\n\nToxicity:\nDespite their therapeutic benefits, cardiac glycosides can be toxic at high doses. Digoxin toxicity is characterized by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and cardiac arrhythmias. Digitoxin toxicity can manifest as similar symptoms, but may also include symptoms such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Factors that increase the risk of toxicity include advanced age, renal insufficiency, and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nIn conclusion, digoxin and digitoxin are cardiac glycosides derived from the foxglove plant that have been used for the treatment of various cardiac conditions due to their positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. Their mechanism of action involves inhibition",

The active compounds in A. annua L. responsible for its therapeutic effects include artemisinin, artesunate, and dihydroartemisinin.\n\nMethods:\nCaco-2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with various concentrations of artemisinin, artesunate, and dihydroartemisinin for 24 hours. The inhibitory effects on NHE2 activity were determined using a fluorescent probe, 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-(p-sulfophenyl)fluorescein (BCECF).\n\nResults:\nAll three compounds significantly inhibited NHE2 activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 values for artemisinin, artesunate, and dihydroartemisinin were 11.2 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b5M, 10.5 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b5M, and 12.8 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b5M, respectively.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe results suggest that the active compounds in Artemisia annua L.

The extract has shown various pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. The article also discusses the possible mechanisms of these activities.\n\nText:\nThe aqueous extract of Fagara zanthoxylina has been subjected to various pharmacological studies. The extract has shown significant anti-inflammatory activity in different models, including carrageenan-induced paw edema, cotton pellet-induced granuloma, and formalin-induced inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effect of the extract may be due to its ability to inhibit the production of nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and cytokines.\n\nThe extract also exhibits antioxidant activity, as evidenced by its ability to scavenge free radicals and reduce lipid peroxidation. The antioxidant effect of the extract may be due to the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and tannins.\n\nThe antimicrobial activity of the extract has been evaluated against various bacteria and fungi. The extract inhibits the growth of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli, and fungi such as Aspergillus niger and Fusarium oxysporum.\n\nThe extract has also shown anticancer activity in different models, including the HepG2 liver cancer cell line and the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. The anticancer effect of the extract may be due to its ability to induce apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation, and suppress angiogenesis.\n\nIn conclusion, the aqueous extract of",

These compounds have been used for the treatment of various cardiac conditions, including heart failure and atrial fibrillation, due to their positive inotropic and chronotropic effects.\n\nMechanisms of Action:\nThe primary mechanism of action for cardiac glycosides involves inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump (Na+,K+-ATPase) in the myocardial cell membrane. This leads to an increase in intracellular sodium ions, which in turn triggers an influx of calcium ions through the sodium-calcium exchange mechanism. The increased intracellular calcium ion concentration results in increased contractility and conduction velocity in the heart.\n\nTherapeutic Uses:\nDigoxin and digitoxin are primarily used in the treatment of heart failure, particularly in cases where the ejection fraction is below 40%. They have also been used to manage atrial fibrillation, as they can help restore normal sinus rhythm. Additionally, these cardiac glycosides have been used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and to prevent premature atrial contractions.\n\nToxicity:\nDespite their therapeutic benefits, cardiac glycosides can be toxic at high doses. Digoxin toxicity is characterized by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and cardiac arrhythmias. Digitoxin toxicity can manifest as similar symptoms, but may also include symptoms such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Factors that increase the risk of toxicity include advanced age, renal insufficiency, and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nIn conclusion, digoxin and digitoxin are cardiac glycosides derived from the foxglove plant that have been used for the treatment of various cardiac conditions due to their positive inotropic and chronotropic effects.

[\n{\"HERB\": [\"Salvia officinalis L.\"]}\n]\n\nThe major components responsible for the analgesic effect of sage are believed to be thujanol, thujyl alcohol, and 1,8-cineole. [\n{\"COMPOUND\": [\"thujanol\", \"thujyl alcohol\", \"1,8-cineole\"]}\n]\n\nThujanol and thujyl alcohol are monoterpenes, while 1,8-cineole is a monoterpene alcohol. [\n{\"COMPOUND\": [\"monoterpenes\", \"thujanol\", \"thujyl alcohol\", \"1,8-cineole\"]}\n]\n\nThese compounds have been shown to inhibit the release of histamine and serotonin from mast cells, thereby exerting an analgesic effect.

[\n{\"MOLECULE\": [\"nitric oxide\", \"prostaglandins\"]}\n]\n\nIn conclusion, the present study provides evidence for the analgesic effect of sage, which can be attributed to the presence of monoterpenes, specifically thujanol, thujyl alcohol, and 1,8-cineole.

Metformin:\n{\"DRUG\": [\"Metformin\"]}\n\nMetformin is a biguanide antidiabetic medication that has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce hepatic glucose production. It is commonly used as a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes.\n\n2. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors:\n{\"DRUG\": [\"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors\"]}\n\nSGLT2 inhibitors are a class of antidiabetic drugs that work by inhibiting the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the proximal tubules of the kidney, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and reduced reabsorption of glucose by the kidneys. Examples of SGLT2 inhibitors include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin.\n\n3. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists:\n{\"PROTEIN\": [\"Glucagon-like peptide-1\"], \"DRUG\": [\"GLP-1 receptor agonists\"]}\n\nGLP-1 is a hormone that plays a role in regulating glucose metabolism and insulin secretion. GLP-1 receptor agonists are synthetic compounds that mimic the effects of GLP-1 and include exenatide, liraglutide, and dulaglutide. These drugs increase insulin secretion, decrease glucagon secretion, and slow gastric emptying, leading to improved glycemic control.\n\n4. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors:\n{\"PROTEIN\": [\"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4\"], \"DRUG\": [\"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors\"]}\n\nDPP-4 is an enzyme that degrades GLP-1 and other peptides.

The extract has shown various pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. The article also discusses the possible mechanisms of these activities.\n\nText:\nThe aqueous extract of Fagara zanthoxylina has been subjected to various pharmacological studies. The extract has shown significant anti-inflammatory activity in different models, including carrageenan-induced paw edema, formalin-induced inflammation, and cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation. The anti-inflammatory effect of the extract may be due to its ability to inhibit the production of nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and cytokines.\n\nThe extract also exhibits antioxidant activity, as evidenced by its ability to scavenge free radicals and reduce lipid peroxidation. The antioxidant effect of the extract may be due to the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and tannins.\n\nThe antimicrobial activity of the extract has been evaluated against various bacteria and fungi. The extract inhibits the growth of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli, and fungi such as Aspergillus niger and Fusarium oxysporum.\n\nThe extract has also shown anticancer activity in different models, including the HepG2 liver cancer cell line and the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. The anticancer effect of the extract may be due to its ability to induce apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation, and suppress angiogenesis.\n\nThe article also discusses the possible mechanisms",
