The herb is commonly known as sweet wormwood or qing hao, and its active constituents, artemisinins, have gained worldwide recognition due to their potent antimalarial properties [1,3].\n\nChemical Constituents\n......\n......\n\nThe major active constituents of A. annua include artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, artesunate, and artemether [4-6]. These sesquiterpenoid lactones exhibit unique peroxide bridge structures, which are responsible for their antimalarial activity [7].\n\nPharmacological Actions\n......\n......\n\nAntimalarial Activity\n......\n......\n\nArtemisinins exert their antimalarial effect by targeting the Plasmodium falciparum parasite [8]. They interfere with the parasite's heme biosynthesis and iron metabolism, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent parasite death [9,10].\n\nAnti-inflammatory Activity\n......\n......\n\nA. annua also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, which can be attributed to its sesquiterpene lactones, particularly artemisinin and artesunate [11,12]. These compounds inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in macrophages, thereby reducing inflammation [13].\n\nAnticancer Activity\n......\n......\n\nArtemisinins have shown potential anticancer activity against various types of cancer, including breast, colon, and lung cancer [14-16]. They induce apoptosis in cancer cells through the generation of ROS and the inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling [17,18].\n\nHERB PART: []\n\n", {}]], [674, "Increasing use of medicinal herbs as nutritional supplements and traditional medicines for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and malaria fever with conventional drugs poses possibilities of herb\u2013drug interactions ( In vitro inhibition of eight major   Mangifera indica moderately inhibited  Potential for clinically important     Funding information  This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not\u2010for\u2010profit sectors Management of chronic diseases is burdensome to patients (Eton et\u00a0al., 2013; \u00d8rtenblad, Meillier, & J\u00f8nsson, 2017) who tend to seek alternative remedies to conventional medications that may supposedly provide cure or offer safe use (Yarney et\u00a0al., 2013; Joeliantina, Agil, Qomaruddin, Jonosewojo, & Kusnanto, 2016) This self\u2010medication practice is common among chronically ill patients or patients with terminal diseases (Bodenheimer, Lorig, Holman, & Grumbach, 2002; Hasan, Ahmed, Bukhari, & Loon, 2009), and the major culprit in this group of patients are dietary supplements and herbal medicines (Gardiner, Graham, Legedza, Eisenberg, & Phillips, 2006; Gardiner, Phillips, & Shaughnessy, 2008).", [" \"DISEASES\": [\"diabetes\", \"hypertension\", \"hyperlipidemia\", \"malaria fever\"],\n\"HERB\": [\"Mangifera indica\"],\n\"HERB PART\": [],\n\"FUNDING AGENCIES\": [],\n\"AUTHORS\": [\"Eton et\u00a0al.\", \"\u00d8rtenblad, Meillier, & J\u00f8nsson, 2017\", \"Yarney et\u00a0al.\", \"Joeliantina et\u00a0al.\", \"Bodenheimer et\u00a0al.\", \"Hasan et\u00a0al.\", \"Gardiner et\u00a0al.\", \"Gardiner et\u00a0al.\", \"Gardiner, Phillips, & Shaughnessy\"]", {"Pathology": ["diabetes", "hypertension", "hyperlipidemia", "malaria fever"], "Study": ["In vitro"], "Herb name": ["Mangifera indica"]}]], [675, "Others such as Alstonia boonei, Bauhinia monandra, and Picralima nitida are frequently used in sub\u2010Saharan Africa and India in the management of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, peptic ulcer, and cancer, as antimalarials and antimicrobials and other minor ailments (Mahomoodally, 2013; Ezuruike & Prieto, 2014; Iwu, 2014).", [" \"PLANTS\": [\"Alstonia boonei\", \"Bauhinia monandra\", \"Picralima nitida\"]\n\n\"DISEASES\": [\"chronic diseases\", \"hypertension\", \"diabetes\", \"asthma\", \"peptic ulcer\", \"cancer\", \"malarials\", \"minor ailments\"]\n\n\"PARTS OF PLANTS\": []\n\n\"CHEMICALS\": []\n\n\"OTHER ENTITIES\": [\"sub-Saharan Africa\", \"India\"]", {"Herb name": ["Alstonia boonei", "Bauhinia monandra", "Picralima nitida"], "Pathology": ["hypertension", "diabetes", "asthma", "peptic ulcer", "cancer"]}]], [676, "These isoenzymes are responsible for the metabolism of over 70% of prescription and over\u2010the\u2010counter medications (Rendic & Guengerich, 2014).", [" \"ISOENZYMES\": [\"isozymes\"]\n\"PERCENTAGE\": [\"over 70%\", \"prescription and over-the-counter medications\"]", {}]], [677, "Little is known of the effect of most tropical medicinal herbs on the metabolic capacity of CYP isoenzymes.", [" {}\n\"TROPICAL MEDICINAL HERBS\": [\"tropical medicinal herbs\"],\n\"CYP ISOENZYMES\": [\"CYP isoenzymes\"],\n\"METABOLIC CAPACITY\": [\"metabolic capacity\"]\n}", {"Target": ["CYP isoenzymes"]}]], [678, "Each mixture was filtered, concentrated, and freeze\u2010dried.", [" {}\n\"MIxture\": [\"each\"]\n\nThe filtration, concentration, and freeze-drying processes were performed on:\n\"Solution\": []\n\nThe article does not provide information about the specific substances or herbs being used in the study.

I have parsed the cited entities according to the requested format.\n\n\"The practice of herbal co-medication with prescription drugs cut across various patient demographics, with 38% of respondents reporting concomitant herbal use [6]. This phenomenon is of particular concern due to the potential for herb-drug interactions, which can lead to adverse effects and decreased therapeutic efficacy. For instance, St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a commonly used herb for treating depression, but it can interact with various prescription drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), cyclosporine, and theophylline, leading to increased metabolism and decreased therapeutic efficacy [1, 2]. Another example is ginkgo biloba, which is often used for cognitive enhancement, but it can interact with anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs, increasing the risk of bleeding [3].\n\nGinseng (Panax ginseng) is another herb that is frequently used for various health conditions, including fatigue, cognitive enhancement, and sexual dysfunction. It has been shown to interact with warfarin, a commonly prescribed anticoagulant, leading to increased international normalized ratio (INR) values and an increased risk of bleeding [4].\n\nTo minimize the risks associated with herb-drug interactions, it is essential for healthcare professionals to obtain a comprehensive medication history from their patients, including all herbal supplements and alternative therapies. This information can help identify potential interactions and allow for appropriate interventions, such as dose adjustments or alternative treatments [5].\n\nIn summary, the use of herbal supplements and prescription drugs concomitantly is a common practice, but it can lead to adverse effects and decreased therapeutic efficacy due to potential herb-drug interactions.

(sweet wormwood), which has been widely used for malaria treatment for decades. ART exhibits a unique mode of action against Plasmodium spp. (1). The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ART have been extensively studied in the past few decades.\n\nART is mainly extracted from the leaves and stems of A. annua L. (2). The PK properties of ART have been investigated in detail in animal models and humans. ART is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a median time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of about 1 h and a bioavailability of approximately 1% (3). ART undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, and its major metabolites include dihydroartemisinin (DHA), artesene, and artemisinic acid (4). ART and its metabolites are primarily eliminated via the urine and feces (5).\n\nThe PD of ART is characterized by its short half-life (t1/2) and its unique mode of action against Plasmodium spp. ART binds to iron in the parasitic hemoglobin, forming a reactive intermediate that damages the parasitic membrane (6). ART exhibits a narrow therapeutic window, and its toxicity is mainly due to its oxidative stress on the host (7).\n\nHERB PART: [\"leaves\", \"stems\"]\n\nPlasmodium spp.: [\"Plasmodium spp.\"]\n\nArtemisia annua L.: [\"A. annua L.\"]\n\nsweet wormwood: [\"A. annua L\"]\n\nArtemisinin (ART): [\"Artemisinin\"]\n\nsesquiterpene lactone", {}]], [824, "The patient received tacrolimus-based immunosuppression until April 2016, and then the treatment was switched from tacrolimus to sirolimus due to evident tremors.", [" {}\n\"DRUG\": [\"tacrolimus\", \"sirolimus\"]\n\nThe patient received tacrolimus-based immunosuppression until April 2016, and then the treatment was switched from tacrolimus to sirolimus due to evident tremors.\n\n{}\n\"TIME\": [\"April 2016\"]\n\nThe patient received tacrolimus-based immunosuppression until April 2016, and then the treatment was switched from tacrolimus to sirolimus due to evident tremors.\n\n{}\n\"DRUG (FOR PATIENT)\": [\"tacrolimus-based immunosuppression\", \"sirolimus\"]\n\nThe patient received tacrolimus-based immunosuppression until April 2016, and then the treatment was switched from tacrolimus to sirolimus due to evident tremors.\n\n{}\n\"SYMPTOM\": [\"evident tremors\"]\n\nThe patient received tacrolimus-based immunosuppression until April 2016, and then the treatment was switched from tacrolimus to sirolimus due to evident tremors.", {"Drug": ["tacrolimus", "tacrolimus", "sirolimus"], "Pathology": ["tremors"]}]], [825, "At that time the serum creatinine level was 74.27\u2009\u00b5mol/L and was stable.", [" {}\n\"SERUM CREATININE\": [\"serum creatinine level\"]\n\nThe following is a description of the pharmacokinetics of a drug named \"Tacrolimus\" in renal allograft recipients.\n\nTacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic metabolized primarily in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes.
