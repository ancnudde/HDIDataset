Impaired insulin secretion: In type 1 diabetes, the destruction of pancreatic beta cells results in a lack of insulin production. In type 2 diabetes, insulin secretion may be initially preserved but eventually decreases as beta cell function deteriorates.\n2. Insulin resistance: This condition, characterized by cells becoming less responsive to insulin, impairs the body's ability to use insulin effectively.\n3. Glucose metabolism dysregulation: In diabetes, the body has difficulty processing glucose, leading to high blood glucose levels.\n4. Hemodynamic changes: Diabetes can cause various hemodynamic alterations, such as increased blood pressure and altered blood flow.\n5. Neuropathy: Diabetes can damage nerves, leading to various complications, including peripheral neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy.\n6. Renal complications: Diabetes can damage the kidneys, leading to complications such as diabetic nephropathy.\n7. Cardiovascular disease: Diabetes significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral arterial disease.\n8.
