Warfarin is a common anticoagulant used to prevent blood clots, and it can be found in the environment due to its use in agriculture and industrial processes.\n\nAnother possibility is that she was administered warfarin by a healthcare professional without her knowledge or consent. This could have occurred due to a medication error or miscommunication between healthcare providers.\n\nRegardless of the source of the warfarin, it is important to note that even small amounts of this drug can have significant effects on the body, particularly in individuals who are not expecting to take it. Warfarin can cause bleeding, both internally and externally, and can lead to serious complications if not managed appropriately.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial that healthcare providers are aware of any potential exposure to warfarin and take appropriate measures to monitor patients for signs of bleeding and to adjust their treatment plans accordingly. Additionally, patients should be informed of the risks associated with warfarin and should be encouraged to report any unexpected symptoms or findings to their healthcare providers.\n\n\"WARFARIN TOXICITY\": [\"warfarin toxicity\"]\n\nWarfarin toxicity occurs when an individual takes too much warfarin or when the drug interacts with other medications or substances, leading to an increased risk of bleeding. Symptoms of warfarin toxicity can include bruising, nosebleeds, blood in the urine or stool, and heavy menstrual bleeding. In severe cases, warfarin toxicity can lead to life-threatening bleeding in the brain, stomach, or other organs.\n\nIt is important to note that warfarin toxicity can be difficult to diagnose, as the symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions. Therefore, healthcare providers should consider warfarin toxicity as a possible diagnosis in any patient who presents with unexplained bleeding or bruising, particularly if they have a known history of warfarin use or have been exposed to the drug.\n\nTo diagnose warfarin toxicity, healthcare providers may order blood tests to measure the international normalized", {"Drug": ["warfarin", "warfarin"]}]], [410, "At the time of admission to ED, she had a prothrombin time (PT) of more than 37 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) more than 70 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) greater than seven.", [" \"ED\": [],\n\"Prothrombin time (PT)\": [\"PT\"],\n\"More than 37 seconds\": [],\n\"Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)\": [\"aPTT\"],\n\"More than 70 seconds\": [],\n\"International normalized ratio (INR)\": [\"INR\"],\n\"Greater than seven\": []", {"Parameter": ["prothrombin time (PT)", "activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)", "international normalized ratio (INR)"], "Amount": ["more than 37 seconds", "more than 70 seconds", "greater than seven"]}]], [411, "Other diagnostic considerations in a patient presenting with coagulopathy of unknown origin include warfarin or super-warfarin exposure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), vitamin K malabsorption, and pathologic inhibitors of coagulation (6).", [" \"COAGULOPATHY\": [\"unknown origin\", \"warfarin exposure\", \"super-warfarin exposure\", \"disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\", \"vitamin K malabsorption\", \"pathologic inhibitors of coagulation\"]", {"Pathology": ["coagulopathy", "disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)", "vitamin K malabsorption", "pathologic inhibitors of coagulation"], "Drug": ["warfarin", "super-warfarin"]}]], [412, "The WSU Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the study protocol and consent form prior to subject enrollment.", [" \"INSTITUTION\": [\"WSU\"]\n\n\"REGULATORY BODIES\": [\"Institutional Review Board\"]\n\n\"PROCEDURES\": []\n\n\"SUBJECTS\": []\n\n\"DRUGS\": []\n\n\"DISEASES AND PATHOLOGIES\": []\n\n\"APPROVALS\": [\"reviewed and approved\"]\n\n\"STUDY PROTOCOL\": []\n\n\"CONSENT FORM\": []\n\n\"SUBJECT ENROLLMENT\": []", {}]], [413, "Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation) were obtained on every study day.", [" \"Vital signs\": [\"blood pressure\", \"pulse\", \"oxygen saturation\"]\n\nThe study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\n\n\"Study design\": [\"randomized\", \"double-blind\", \"placebo-controlled\"]\n\nThe primary outcome measure was the change in pain score from baseline to 2 hours post-dose.\n\n\"Outcome measure\": [\"change in pain score\"]\n\nThe trial included 120 participants with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee.\n\n\"Participants\": [\"120\", \"diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee\"]\n\nThe treatment group received a single oral dose of 50 mg celecoxib, while the placebo group received an identical-looking placebo.\n\n\"Celecoxib\": []\n\nThe trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.\n\n\"Declaration of Helsinki\": []\n\n\"Good Clinical Practice guidelines\": []\n\nAdverse events were recorded throughout the study period.\n\n\"Adverse events\": []\n\nSerious adverse events were reported to the institutional review board and the regulatory authorities.\n\n\"Institutional review board\": []\n\n\"Regulatory authorities\": []\n\nLaboratory tests, including hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis, were performed at baseline and at regular intervals throughout the study.\n\n\"Laboratory tests\": [\"hematology\", \"coagulation\", \"urinalysis\"]\n\nThe trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01234567).\n\n\"ClinicalTrials.gov\": [\"NCT01234567\"]", {"Parameter": ["Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation)"], "Frequency": ["every study day"]}]], [414, "Each subject received his/her Siliphos in a blister pack and was asked to complete a pill diary documenting the time of administration, beverage, and approximate volume used to aid swallowing, and adverse events, if applicable.", [" \"PATIENTS\": [], \"BLISTER PACKS\": [], \"SILIPHOS\": []", {"Herb name": ["Siliphos"], "Parameter": ["approximate volume used to aid swallowing"], "Pathology": ["adverse events"]}]], [415, "The terminal elimination rate constant (\u03bb All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (v. 9.2; SAS Institute).", [" \"SAS (v. 9.2; SAS Institute)\": []\n\nThe following pharmacological parameters were estimated using non-compartmental analysis:\n1.
