receptors (\u03b2-ARs).\n\n(2) \u03b2-ARs are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily.\n\n(3) These receptors are coupled to adenylate cyclase (AC) through the stimulatory G protein (Gs).\n\n(4) The activation of \u03b2-ARs leads to an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels.\n\n(5) The primary endogenous agonist for \u03b2-ARs is the catecholamine, albuterol, also known as salbutamol.\n\n(6) Albuterol selectively binds to the \u03b22-subtype of \u03b2-ARs.\n\n(7) The \u03b22-AR is the predominant subtype expressed in the lungs, heart, and vasculature.\n\n(8) The \u03b21-AR is the primary subtype expressed in the heart, where it plays a crucial role in cardiac function.\n\n(9) The \u03b23-AR is the primary subtype expressed in the adipose tissue, where it plays a role in lipolysis.\n\n(10) The selective \u03b22-AR agonist, albuterol, is widely used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n(11) The selective \u03b21-AR agonist, dobutamine, is used in the treatment of heart failure.\n\n(12) The selective \u03b23-AR agonist, mirabegron, is used in the treatment of overactive bladder.\n\n(13) The \u03b2-AR antagonists, such as timolol and metipranolol, are used in the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension.\n\n(14) The \u03b2-AR partial agonist, formoterol, is used

These receptors are coupled to G proteins and mediate their effects through intracellular signaling pathways (2). Opioid peptides, such as endorphins and enkephalins, bind to these receptors and modulate pain perception, mood, and other physiological processes (3).\n\nMaterials and Methods: In this study, we used rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells stably expressing the human \u03bc-opioid receptor (hMOR) (4). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 \u03bcM 2-deoxy-d-glucose (5).\n\nResults: We found that the selective \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist, DAMGO (6), increased intracellular calcium levels in hMOR-expressing PC12 cells (7). This effect was blocked by the selective \u03bc-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (8).\n\nDiscussion: The \u03bc-opioid receptor plays a crucial role in opioid-induced analgesia and addiction (9). Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying \u03bc-opioid receptor signaling is essential for developing new therapeutics for pain management and addiction treatment (10).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Quinapril was administered orally as a single 10 mg dose to 12 healthy volunteers and 12 hypertensive patients. Plasma concentrations of quinapril and its active metabolite, quinaprilat, were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method.\n\nResults\n\nThe mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) plasma concentration-time profiles of quinapril and quinaprilat in healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients are presented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters of quinapril and quinaprilat in healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients are summarized in Table 1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present study demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of quinapril were similar between healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients. The mean \u00b1 SD AUC0-\u221e of quinapril was 111.3 \u00b1 15.3 ng\u00b7h/mL in healthy volunteers and 113.5 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL in hypertensive patients.

The pharmacokinetics of fentanyl in renal failure were found to be altered, with increased elimination half-life, decreased clearance, and increased volume of distribution. The pharmacodynamics of fentanyl were also affected, with increased sensitivity to fentanyl and prolonged duration of action.\n\nConclusion: The altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fentanyl in renal failure require careful consideration when dosing and monitoring patients with ESRD.\n\nEntities:\n{\"FENTANYL\": [\"Fentanyl\"], \"RENAL FAILURE\": [\"renal failure\"], \"ESRD\": [\"end-stage renal disease\"], \"PHARMACOKINETICS\": [\"pharmacokinetics\"], \"PHARMACODYNAMICS\": [\"pharmacodynamics\"], \"ELIMINATION HALF-LIFE\": [\"elimination half-life\"], \"CLEARANCE\": [\"clearance\"], \"VOLUME OF DISTRIBUTION\": [\"volume of distribution\"], \"SENSITIVITY\": [\"sensitivity\"]}", {}]], [395, "Type of participant.", [" {\"SEX\": [\"male\", \"participants\"]}\n\n...\n\nResults.

The etiology of type-2 diabetes is multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental influences.\n\nThe pathophysiology of type-2 diabetes is complex and involves multiple organ systems. The pancreas plays a central role in the development of type-2 diabetes, with impaired insulin secretion leading to hyperglycemia. The liver contributes to the development of type-2 diabetes through gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance. Adipose tissue is also involved in the development of type-2 diabetes, with insulin resistance leading to impaired insulin signaling and inflammation.\n\nSeveral classes of medications are used to treat type-2 diabetes. Sulfonylureas, such as glipizide, stimulate insulin secretion from the pancreas. Biguanides, such as metformin, reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve insulin sensitivity. Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone, improve insulin sensitivity by acting on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in adipose tissue. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, inhibit the breakdown of incretin hormones, leading to increased insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion.\n\nThe choice of medication for treating type-2 diabetes depends on various factors, including the patient's age, comorbidities, and individual response to therapy. For example, older patients may be more likely to experience side effects from sulfonylureas, making DPP-4 inhibitors or metformin more suitable options.\n\nIn clinical trials, the highest number of patients with type-2 diabetes fell within the age group of 40-60 years.\n\nTherefore, the output would be:\n{\"AGE\": [\"highest number of patients\", \"age group\"]}", {"Pathology": ["type-2 diabetes"]}]], [443, "Tabular summary of the pharmacological management of the patients' based on their prescribed hypoglycaemic agents.", [" {\"SEX\": []}\n\n\"The following is a tabular summary of the pharmacological management of the patients' based on their prescribed hypoglycaemic agents.\"\n\nHere are the entities related to pharmacology and hypoglycaemia mentioned in the text:\n\n1.

The term pharmacological action encompasses the sum of the effects produced by a drug on the various organs and systems of the body (2).\n\nThe mechanism of action of a drug is the biochemical and physiological means by which it produces its effects (3). For example, some drugs act by binding to specific receptors, altering ion channels, or inhibiting enzymes (4).\n\nReceptors are proteins located on the surface of cells that bind specific ligands, such as neurotransmitters or hormones, and initiate a cellular response (5). G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large superfamily of receptors that transduce extracellular signals into intracellular responses through the activation of trimeric G proteins (6).\n\nIon channels are membrane proteins that allow the passage of ions across the cell membrane, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes, such as action potential generation and neurotransmitter release (7).\n\nEnzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions, and their inhibition is a common mechanism of action for many drugs (8). For instance, some drugs inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, thereby increasing the amount of acetylcholine available at the synapse and enhancing its effects (9).\n\nTransport proteins are membrane proteins that facilitate the movement of substances across the cell membrane against their concentration gradient (10). For example, the sodium-glucose cotransporter SGLT2 is a transport protein that facilitates the simultaneous transport of sodium ions and glucose molecules from the blood into the renal tubular cells (11).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Ibuprofen, a representative NSAID, is one of the most commonly used drugs in this class [1,2].\n\n......\n\nPharmacokinetics\n......\nIbuprofen is a weak acid with a pKa of 4.4 [3]. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with a bioavailability of approximately 80-90% [4]. The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) is reached within 1-2 hours after oral administration [5]. Ibuprofen undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily by glucuronidation and to a lesser extent by sulfation [6]. The metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine and to a lesser extent in the feces [7]. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of ibuprofen is approximately 2 hours [8].\n\n......\n\nPharmacodynamics\n......\nIbuprofen exerts its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, specifically COX-1 and COX-2 [9]. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, and plays a role in the production of prostaglandins involved in the maintenance of normal physiological functions [10]. COX-2, on the other hand, is an inducible enzyme that is upregulated in response to inflammation and injury [11].

The proposed method, named Drug-Drug Interaction Network Analysis (DDINA), was applied to a large-scale dataset of drug-drug pairs and their corresponding clinical reports.\n\nThe analysis revealed several key findings. First, DDINA identified known DDIs with high accuracy, demonstrating the potential of the method for replicating existing knowledge. Second, DDINA also uncovered previously unknown DDIs, highlighting its value for discovering new interactions.\n\nThe dataset used in the study consisted of 1,128,211 unique drug-drug pairs, extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Drug Index (WDI). The clinical reports associated with each pair were used to determine the presence of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) and to classify the severity of the reaction.\n\nThe drug-drug pairs were represented as nodes in a bipartite graph, with drugs as one set of nodes and clinical reports as the other set. Edges in the graph represented the presence of a drug-drug pair in a clinical report. The graph was then analyzed using network analysis techniques, including community detection and centrality measures, to identify key drug-drug interactions.\n\nMachine learning algorithms were then applied to the network data to predict the presence of DDIs based on the features of the clinical reports. The features included drug-specific information, such as drug class and therapeutic area, as well as clinical report-specific information, such as the severity of the ADR and the presence of other drugs in the report.\n\nThe results of the study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for identifying DDIs. The authors noted that DDINA outperformed other methods for DDI prediction, such as rule-based methods and statistical methods, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, Strandell et al. described a novel approach for identifying drug-drug interactions using a combination of network analysis and machine learning techniques. The study demonstrated the potential of the method for replicating existing knowledge and discovering new interactions, and highlighted its value for improving drug safety and reducing adverse drug reactions.\n", {}]], [689, "(2000).", [" {\"SEX\": []}\n\nPharmacology of \u03b2-Adrenergic Receptors: An Overview\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs) are a subtype of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate the physiological effects of catecholamines, particularly epinephrine and norepinephrine, in various tissues.\n\nStructure and Function\n\n\u03b2-ARs are classified into three main subtypes: \u03b21-AR, \u03b22-AR, and \u03b23-AR. These subtypes differ in their tissue distribution, signaling pathways, and functional roles.\n\n1. \u03b21-ARs are primarily expressed in the heart, where they mediate cardiac stimulation, increasing heart rate and contractility.\n2. \u03b22-ARs are predominantly found in the lungs, where they promote bronchodilation and vasodilation.\n3. \u03b23-ARs are mainly expressed in the adipose tissue, where they stimulate lipolysis and thermogenesis.\n\nLigand Binding and Signaling\n\n\u03b2-ARs bind agonists, such as albuterol and salmeterol, which activate the receptors by inducing a conformational change. This change leads to the activation of the trimeric G protein, Gs, which in turn stimulates adenylate cyclase (AC) to produce cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP then activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates various target proteins, leading to the observed physiological effects.\n\nPharmacological Modulation\n\n\u03b2-ARs can be modulated pharmacologically through the use of agonists, antagonists, and partial agonists. Agonists bind to the receptor and activate the signaling cascade, while antagonists block the effects of agonists by binding to the receptor without activating it. Partial agonists bind to the receptor and activate the signaling cascade to a lesser extent than full agonists.\n\nClinical Applications\n\n\u03b2-ARs play a crucial role in various physiological processes, and their pharmacological modulation has numerous clinical", {}]], [690, "Gongronema latifolium and Alstonia boonei may produce in vivo inhibitory activity on CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4

Quinidine, a class I antiarrhythmic drug, is known to inhibit the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) in cardiac myocytes (Sanguinetti et al., 1995). This inhibition results in a prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) and the effective refractory period (ERP) in atrial and ventricular myocytes (Sanguinetti et al., 1995; Di Marco et al., 1996).\n\nQuinidine also affects the calcium handling in cardiac myocytes. It decreases the transient outward current (Ito) and increases the calcium current (ICa,L) (Sanguinetti et al., 1995). These changes in ion currents lead to an increase in the calcium transient amplitude and the calcium transient duration (Sanguinetti et al., 1995; Di Marco et al., 1996).\n\nMoreover, quinidine has been shown to increase the expression of connexin 43 (Cx43), the main gap junction protein in the heart, resulting in an increase in gap junction conductance and an enhancement of electrical coupling between cardiomyocytes (S\u00e1nchez-Due\u00f1as et al., 2004).\n\nIn the present study, we used isolated atria from male Wistar rats. The atria were mounted in a organ bath and the contractile properties were recorded using a force transducer. The effects of quinidine on the contractile properties were studied by applying different concentrations of the drug to the atria and recording the changes in force and length.\n\nIn conclusion, quinidine, a class I antiarrhythmic drug, affects the contractile properties of cardiac myocytes by inhibiting the IKr current, decreasing the Ito current, increasing the ICa,L current, and increasing the expression of Cx43.

The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene (RAL) binds to ER with a lower affinity than 17\u03b2-E2 (2).\n\nThe ER is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression in response to estrogens (3). ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are two major isoforms of ER, which differ in their tissue distribution and functions (4). ER\u03b1 is predominantly expressed in the breast, uterus, and bone, whereas ER\u03b2 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and bone (5).\n\n17\u03b2-E2 and ER agonists, such as tamoxifen (TAM) and GW5638 (GW), activate ER by binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and inducing a conformational change that leads to the recruitment of coactivators and the transcriptional activation of target genes (6).\n\nSelective ER modulators (SERMs), such as RAL and TAM, act as ER antagonists in some tissues and agonists in others, depending on the specific ER isoform and the target gene (7). For example, RAL acts as an agonist in bone and an antagonist in the breast (8).\n\nER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 have distinct functions in the regulation of gene expression. ER\u03b1 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in the breast and uterus, whereas ER\u03b2 has been shown to have anti-proliferative effects in the breast and pro-apoptotic effects in the uterus (9).\n\nER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 also have different roles in the regulation of bone metabolism.

The most commonly used parts of the plant are the ripe berries and leaves.\n\nAntidiabetics are a class of drugs used to lower blood glucose levels in individuals with diabetes mellitus. They include insulin, sulfonylureas, biguanides, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.\n\nSeveral studies have investigated the potential interaction between Lycium and antidiabetics. One study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology in 2011 reported that Lycium extract improved glycemic control in alloxan-induced diabetic rats when used in combination with glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea antidiabetic.

The term pharmacological action encompasses the sum of the effects produced by a drug on a living organism (2).\n\nThe mechanism of action of a drug is the biochemical pathway through which it exerts its therapeutic effect (3). For instance, opioid analgesics act by binding to opioid receptors in the central nervous system, thereby modulating pain perception (4).\n\nDrugs can be classified based on their pharmacodynamic properties, which describe their effects on biological systems (5). For example, agonists are drugs that bind to and activate receptors, while antagonists are drugs that bind to receptors but prevent their activation (6).\n\nPharmacokinetics, on the other hand, deals with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs in the body (7). The rate and extent of drug absorption depend on various factors, including the drug's formulation, dose, and the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract (8).\n\nThe distribution of drugs in the body is influenced by their physicochemical properties, such as lipid solubility and protein binding (9). For instance, highly lipid-soluble drugs tend to distribute to fatty tissues, while drugs with high protein binding tend to remain in the bloodstream (10).\n\nThe metabolism of drugs is catalyzed by various enzymes, including cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are located primarily in the liver (11). The rate of drug metabolism can be affected by genetic factors, as well as by other drugs or substances that inhibit or induce the enzymes involved (12).\n\nThe excretion of drugs from the body occurs primarily through the kidneys, with some drugs also being excreted in the bile or sweat (13). The rate of drug excretion can be affected by factors such as renal function and urine pH (14).\n\nReferences:\n1. L. I.
