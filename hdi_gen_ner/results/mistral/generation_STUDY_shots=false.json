Cannabinoids exert their analgesic effects through interaction with the endocannabinoid system, which consists of endogenous ligands, receptors, and enzymes. The two main receptors, CB1 and CB2, are expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system, as well as in immune cells. The endocannabinoid system plays a role in the modulation of pain transmission, inflammation, and neuroprotection. Several cannabinoids, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and synthetic agonists and antagonists, have been investigated for their analgesic properties in various experimental models of pain.

The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is the primary body for the scientific evaluation of medicines [2]. The CHMP makes recommendations on marketing authorization, which are then adopted by the European Commission [3].\n\nThe regulatory environment in Europe has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the aim of increasing efficiency and transparency in the regulatory process [4]. One of the most notable changes has been the implementation of a centralized procedure for marketing authorization applications, which allows for a single application to be evaluated by the EMA on behalf of all EU member states [5].\n\nAnother important aspect of the European regulatory environment is the role of the European Medicines Agency's Network of Experts, which provides scientific advice to applicants during the development of new medicines [6]. The Network of Experts includes experts from various fields, including pharmacology, toxicology, and clinical medicine [7].\n\nThe practical effects of these changes have been significant. For example, the centralized procedure has led to a reduction in the time required for marketing authorization, with the average time for approval being around 21 months [8]. Additionally, the role of the European Medicines Agency's Network of Experts has facilitated more effective communication between applicants and regulatory authorities, leading to a more streamlined development process for new medicines [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the European Medicines Agency plays a crucial role in the regulatory environment for medicines in the European Union. The implementation of a centralized procedure for marketing authorization applications and the role of the European Medicines Agency's Network of Experts have led to increased efficiency and transparency in the regulatory process, resulting in a more streamlined development process for new medicines.\n\nReferences:\n[1] European Medicines Agency.
