Rifampicin is a bactericidal antibiotic that inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis by binding to the beta subunit of RNA polymerase [25, 26]. Cyclosporine A is an immunosuppressant that inhibits the calcineurin-dependent signaling pathway, leading to the suppression of T-cell activation and proliferation [27, 28].\n\nThe effects of rifampicin and cyclosporine A on P-glycoprotein (PGP) expression and activity have been investigated in various studies.

Serotonergic and noradrenergic systems are implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety and mood disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly used pharmacological treatments for these disorders.\n\nSerotonin (5-HT) plays a crucial role in the regulation of mood, anxiety, and cognition. The 5-HT system is composed of 18 distinct receptors, which can be divided into seven families: 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. The 5-HT1 family consists of seven receptors: 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C.

[" {\"Drug interactions\": []}\n\nThe complex interplay between drugs and their targets in the body can lead to unintended consequences, some of which may manifest as clinically significant drug-drug

DDIs can be classified into several categories based on their mechanisms, including: pharmacodynamic interactions, pharmacokinetic interactions, and metabolic interactions.\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions:\n{\"Pharmacodynamic interactions\": [\"pharmacodynamic interactions\"]}\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions occur when the combined effects of two or more drugs on a biological system result in altered responses compared to the individual effects of each drug. These interactions can manifest as increased or decreased efficacy, altered toxicity, or altered time courses of drug action. For example, the combination of warfarin and aspirin can lead to increased risk of bleeding due to synergistic inhibition of platelet function.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions:\n{\"Pharmacokinetic interactions\": [\"pharmacokinetic interactions\"]}\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions occur when the presence of one drug affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of another drug. For instance, the co-administration of cimetidine and theophylline can lead to increased theophylline levels due to inhibition of theophylline metabolism by cimetidine.\n\nMetabolic interactions:\n{\"Metabolic interactions\": [\"metabolic interactions\"]}\n\nMetabolic interactions are a subset of pharmacokinetic interactions and specifically refer to interactions that involve the metabolism of drugs by enzymes. These interactions can result in altered drug metabolism rates, altered metabolite profiles, or altered drug-metabolizing enzyme activity. For example, the co-administration of fluconazole and cyclosporine can lead to increased cyclosporine levels due to inhibition of cyclosporine metabolism by fluconazole.\n\nIn conclusion, drug-drug interactions can have significant clinical consequences and can be classified into several categories based on their mechanisms.
