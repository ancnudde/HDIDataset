For instance, cinnamon extract has been shown to inhibit 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17\u03b2-HSD), an enzyme involved in the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone, thereby reducing testosterone levels and improving the hormonal imbalance in PCOS women.\n\nAnother herb, licorice, contains glycyrrhizic acid, which has been reported to inhibit 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-HSD), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of cortisol and androgens. This inhibition may contribute to the reduction of androgen levels and the improvement of menstrual regularity in PCOS women.\n\nFurthermore, some herbs have been shown to affect insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. For example, fenugreek extract has been reported to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce serum triglyceride levels in PCOS women. Similarly, turmeric, which contains curcumin, has been shown to improve lipid profile and reduce inflammation in PCOS women.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of herbal mixtures in the treatment of PCOS offers promising benefits on hormonal and metabolic abnormalities.
