from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not\u2010for\u2010profit sectors Management of chronic diseases is burdensome to patients (Eton et\u00a0al., 2013; \u00d8rtenblad, Meillier, & J\u00f8nsson, 2017) who tend to seek alternative remedies to conventional medications that may supposedly provide cure or offer safe use (Yarney et\u00a0al., 2013; Joeliantina, Agil, Qomaruddin, Jonosewojo, & Kusnanto, 2016) This self\u2010medication practice is common among chronically ill patients or patients with terminal diseases (Bodenheimer, Lorig, Holman, & Grumbach, 2002; Hasan, Ahmed, Bukhari, & Loon, 2009), and the major culprit in this group of patients are dietary supplements and herbal medicines (Gardiner, Graham, Legedza, Eisenberg, & Phillips, 2006; Gardiner, Phillips,
